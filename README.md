# Pokémon Moral Alignment

Answer a series of questions to find where you stand on a moral alignment chart and have your results compared to a Pokémon's equivalent alignment.

## What is a Moral Alignment Chart?

Moral alignments are used in [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) to describe characters. The chart contains [three rows and columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments), and each intersection describes a character's moral compass. The first axis describes good vs. evil, and the second is lawful vs. chaotic.

### Axes

Lawful: Will follow the law just because it is the law.<br />
Chaotic: Will do what they wish with no regard for the law.<br />
Good: Actively seeks to help others. <br />
Evil: Actively seeks to hurt others.
